Thanks for downloading this transformation pack.

This is a major update for my Windows 8.1 to Windows 7 Transformation Pack, now taking the form of an easy-to-use installer that transforms the whole system for you. It is not 100% perfect so don't be disappointed that it doesn't look 100% like Windows 7.
This transformation pack is only for Windows 8.0 and Windows 8.1.

Rules of distribution, the credits, and all of that stuff can be found in the Terms and Conditions inside of the installer.


Info: 
- If you're using Windows 8.0, you MUST update your system to at least 2021's set of Windows Updates to prevent Windows 8 from bricking when Fonts are replaced
- When finished, Restarting will take unusually long (and in some cases Windows will act like you haven't logged in before, showing the first logon screen before the screen then goes black). This is normal due to Windows booting into "Setup Mode" - let it restart itself, as it WILL restart itself in a few minutes or so of that happening.
