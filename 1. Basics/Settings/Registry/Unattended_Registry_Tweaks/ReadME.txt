these are useful if you want to slipstream this transformation pack in an iso and make all default users use these settings.
not recommended for already installed 8.x.

Slipstream the other registry tweaks too!

(Also OldNewExplorer, Taskbar tweaker and startisback need to be installed on the operating system before using these registry tweaks)
