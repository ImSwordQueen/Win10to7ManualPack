SecureUXTheme does not modify system files and can survive windows updates.

UltraUXTheme patches system files and could result in a black screen if an update unpatches UXTheme related files while the theme is applied (Only if you copy the aero.msstyles inside the aero folder)

If you are affected by the black screen of death use this guide to fix it: https://www.eastcoast.hosting/Windows9/fixblackscreen.html (You have to reapply the UXTheme patch)
